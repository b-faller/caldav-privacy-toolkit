# CalDAV Privacy Toolkit

This is a Python script that allows you to modify the
privacy setting of events in a Nextcloud CalDAV calendar.

## Getting Started

To use the script, simply run the `main.py` file using Python 3. You will be
prompted to enter the URL of the Nextcloud CalDAV calendar, as well as your
username and password. Once you have entered this information, the script will
connect to the server and retrieve your calendars.

For each calendar, the script will prompt you whether to change the privacy
setting of events in the calendar. If you choose yes, all events in the calendar
will be set to CONFIDENTIAL.
